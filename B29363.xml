            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lords of Council and Session considering, That whereas His Sacred <hi>Majesty,</hi> by His Letter direct to them the 19. of <hi>May,</hi> 1674. did declare, that He found it indispensibly necessar for His service, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of His Authority, and for the quiet and security of His Subjects in their fortunes and estates, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Authority of the Colledge of Justice be inviolably preserved; and that there be an intire confidence in, and deference to all the Decreets and Sentences thereof; And that He will constantly maintain His Authority exercised in that Court, against all incroachments, indignities and reproaches: And did declare His dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with, and abhorrence of all Appeals from the Lords; And did strictly prohibit the charging of any of their Decrets or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences with in justice, whether in the terms of Appeals, Protestations, or any other manner of way, publickly or privatly, under the pain of being utterly secluded from any office in, or depending on the Colledge of Justice: Yet by that same Letter, His <hi>Majesty</hi> is graciously pleased, That the Lords should proceed no further against these Advocats, who refused to give their oaths concerning the Appeals given in by the Lord <hi>Almond,</hi> if they did solemnly disowne the same, and all other Appeals and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, which might any wayes import the charging the Sentences, or Interloquutors of the Lords with injustice: And in case they did refuse to disown the same, His <hi>Majesty</hi> did thereby peremptorly command the Lords to debarr them from any part of their function as Advocats, in time coming. And they having refused to disown the same: Therefore, by Sentence of the Lords of the 24 of <hi>Juny,</hi> 1674. three of the saids Advocats were debarred from their said function, and in like manner, another of these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocats was debarred by Sentence of the Lords, the 24. of <hi>November</hi> 1674. And, because fourty other Advocats did desert the house, when the Lords were sitting, that very day that their Sentence against the first three was intimate, and did continue will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to desert their attendance on the House, though ofttimes required and citted to attend the same with certification, that these Advocats, who, without lawful excuse to be approven by the Lords, should continue to absent themselves, should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the exercising the office of Advocats thereafter: They were therefore, by sentence of the Lords, the 3. of <hi>July,</hi> 1674. debarred from exercising the office of Advocats thereafter. Likeas, His <hi>Majesty,</hi> by His Letter of the 14. of <hi>July</hi> 1674. did approve what the Lords had done, in relation to all the saids debarred Advocats; And by His other Letter, the 12. of <hi>December</hi> 1674. His <hi>Majesty</hi> did declare, <hi>in verbo Principis,</hi> That such of these Advocats, as should not, betwixt and the 28 of <hi>January,</hi> 1675. make application to the Lords for re-entry, to be presented to His <hi>Majesty</hi> (in manner formerly prescribed) should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be re-admitted to that function thereafter: Requiring the Lords forthwith to cause Print, and Publish His Royal Pleasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by way of Proclamation; which was done accordingly. After which Proclamation, and before the said 28. of <hi>January,</hi> 1675. Fifteen of these outted Advocats did give in Petitions severally to the Lords, in the terms of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Proclamation; which being found satisfactory by the Lords, were sent to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and were returned with His <hi>Majesties</hi> Royal Pleasure, to re-enter them to the exercise of their imployments. And many moe of the saids outted Advocats did give in a joynt Petition to the Lords, before the said 28. of <hi>January,</hi> 1675. but in general and dubious terms: And therefore the Lords required the same to be cleared, and that each of them should give in a several Petition to that effect, declaring, that untill that were done, they could not transmit the same to His <hi>Majestie</hi> as satisfactory; and accordingly, some of the saids Advocats did, after the said day, present new Petitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory of the former. And the Lords continuing in their zeal, ro lay hold on every opportunity for reclaiming these Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats to their dutie, They, by their Letter, of the 17. of <hi>June</hi> last, gave His <hi>Majesty</hi> an account of that affair; whereupon His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> did Authorize, and require the Lords to admit the Petitioners therein named, to the exercise of their function, as Advocats: And likewise, to re-admit such of the rest of the outted Advocates, as should petition in the terms of the foresaid explanatorie Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. As also, the Lords having considered His <hi>Majesties</hi> Letter, of the 11. of <hi>December,</hi> 1675. together with the inclosed Petition presented to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> by four of these outted Advocats, whereby they disown, and disclaim all Appeals, which fist process, and stop execution, as being contrar to Law, and in-consistent with the honour of the Lords of Session, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Subjects in their just rights; and wherein they declare, that they shall not in their practice advise, or countenance any Protestations for remeed of Law in time coming. And wherein they do acknowledge, that all the Subjects, both Advocats, and others should pay all reverence, submission and respect to the Persons and Sentences of the Lords of Session, and that they shall never quarrel, nor impugne any of their Sentences or Interloquutors, but by Petitions, Suspensions, or Reductions only to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented before the Lords themselves, as hath been customary in former times, and allowed to be practised by their predecessours. And as His <hi>Majesty</hi> doth in the said Letter, of new expresse, His fixed and unaterable purpose, inviolably to preserve the Jurisdiction and Authority of the Lords of Session, and severely to punish all designs and courses to the prejudice, or derogation thereof, as indispensibly necessar for His <hi>Majesties</hi> interest: So, in pursuance of His <hi>Majesties</hi> pleasure, and commands His <hi>Majesty</hi> doth of new declare, That he will not suffer or allow any Appeals or Protestations to be made use of against their Acts, Interloquutors, or Sentences: Requiring the Lords to punish all attempts, or designs of that kind, according to His <hi>Majesties</hi> former pleasure. And albeit His <hi>Majesty</hi> understands perfectly, that whole affair, and the certifications which these outted Advocats have incurred, yet being now
<pb facs="tcp:207748:2"/>satisfied with their declarations, acknowledgments, and submissions in the said Petition; He is graciously pleased to dispense with all certifications, and other restrictions, not only as to those who signed the said inclosed Petition: But also, as to all others who shall subscribe the like Petitions betwixt and the 10. of <hi>January</hi> next, and present the same to the Lords. As also, His <hi>Majesty</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes all such Advocats, who have already, or within the said time shal subscribe the like Petitions, to re-enter to their imployments, and to enjoy all Priviledges, and Liberties thereto belonging, as if they had never been debarred therefra And as His <hi>Majesty</hi> hath manifested extraordinary Grace and Favour, towards these <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dvocats; So he doth confidently expect, they will demean themselves as becomes dutyful and loyal Subjects, and will henceforth give His <hi>Majesty</hi> no occasion, to signifie His Royal pleasure against any of them with a due remembrance of what hath past. And His <hi>Majesty</hi> thereby requires the Lords to give all due Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to these Advocats, who have remained in their dutie, and that these other Advocats, whom His <hi>Majesty</hi> hath been graciously pleased to restore, live peaceably and in concord with them: And His <hi>Majesty</hi> ordains the said Letter to be intimat to all these Advocats, and recorded in the Books of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> as a full declaration of His <hi>Majesties</hi> pleasure, and as the rule of their practice, whereunto they shall be oblidged to conform themselves. The Lords did immediately, upon the receit of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Letter, call the four Advocats, whose petition was inclosed, who having adhered thereto, the Lords did declare that, they might return to the exercise of their imployment as Advocats, as fully, and freely; as they might have done before the Decret and Sentence of the Lords debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them from any part of their function as Advocats. Which Decreet, the Lords do hereby rescind for the causes forsaid: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, the Lords having received petitions from others of the saids outted Advocats, each for himself severally, before the 10. of <hi>January</hi> instant; the Lords did also accept of the same as satisfactory, conform to His <hi>Majesties</hi> Letter, and did declare, that they might re-enter to the exercise of their imployments, as Advocats, as fully and freely as they might have done before the Decreet and Sentence of the Lords debarring them from exercising the office of Advocats, of the 3. of <hi>July,</hi> 1674. Which, as to them, the Lords do in like manner rescind, as they did formerly rescind the same: and the sentence of the Lords, the 24. of <hi>November</hi> 1674. as to the Advocats, who were debarred, and were at several times before re-entered to the exercise of their said office, as Advocats, as fully and freely, as they were before the said Decreet whereby they were debarred, <hi>viz.</hi> S. <hi>George Lockhart,</hi> S. <hi>John Cunningham,</hi> S. <hi>George Mackenʒie,</hi> S. <hi>Robert Sinclair,</hi> S. <hi>John Harper,</hi> S. <hi>Colin Campbel,</hi> M. <hi>Thomas Learmonth,</hi> M. <hi>David Dunmuir, Walter Pringle,</hi> M. <hi>William Monnypennie,</hi> M. <hi>William Hamiltoun, James Broun,</hi> M. <hi>Archibald Hop,</hi> M. <hi>John Lander,</hi> M. <hi>William Murray,</hi> M. <hi>Colin Mackenʒie,</hi> M. <hi>Robert Bennet,</hi> M. <hi>John Baillie,</hi> M. <hi>Roderick Mackenʒie</hi> elder, M. <hi>George Rannerman,</hi> M. <hi>William Weir,</hi> M. <hi>James Binning,</hi> M. <hi>William Moor,</hi> M. <hi>James Hunter,</hi> M. <hi>Alexander Anderson,</hi> M. <hi>William Barllie,</hi> M. <hi>George Dickson,</hi> M. <hi>Bobert Deans.</hi> M. <hi>William Clerk,</hi> M. <hi>David Dewar,</hi> M. <hi>John Colvill,</hi> M. <hi>William Dundas, George Gibson,</hi> M. <hi>James Borthwick,</hi> M. <hi>James Brisbain,</hi> M. <hi>David Cunningham,</hi> M. <hi>Patrick Smith,</hi> M. <hi>James Grant,</hi> M. <hi>Richard Dowglas,</hi> M. <hi>James Falconer,</hi> M. <hi>Roderick Mackenʒie</hi> younger, M. <hi>Alexander Campbel,</hi> M. <hi>Robert Buchannan,</hi> M. <hi>Edward Wright,</hi> M. <hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> M. <hi>John Kincaid,</hi> M. <hi>John Inglis,</hi> M. <hi>John Eleis,</hi> and M. <hi>Hugh Wallace.</hi> Likeas the Lords, according to His <hi>Majesties</hi> Letter, bearing, that all the outted Advocats who had already subscribed the like Petitions, to that inclosed in His <hi>Majesties</hi> Letter; Or should subscribe the same before the tenth of <hi>January,</hi> should enjoy all liberties and priviledges belonging to their office, as effectually to all intents and purposes, as if they had never been debarred. Therefore the Lords do declare, that all the saids Advocats are equally free, in the exercise of their imployments, without any engagement lying upon one more than others of them. And farder, the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ords do declare, that all the saids Advocats re-entered now and before, have satisfied and fulfilled His <hi>Majesties</hi> Proclamation foresaid, of the date the twelfth day of <hi>December,</hi> 1674. As having now severally, and sufficiently explained the petitions given in by them, before the 28. of <hi>January,</hi> 1675. Likeas, the Lords considering, that it is convenient and proper for them to clear that which may prevent the ensnaring any person, by that expression contained in the petition inclosed in His <hi>Majesties</hi> Letter, bearing, that these Advocats will not quarrel, nor impugne the Sentences or, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquutors of the Lords; But by Suspensions, Petitions, or Reductions only to be intented before the Lords themselves, as hath been customary in former times, and hath been allowed to be practised by their Predecessors: Therefore the Lords do declare, that it was never allowed by the Lords, to quarrel, or impugne their Sentences, or Interloquutors, upon iniquitie; and that they will in no wayes suffer, or allow the same, but will severely censure such as shall in any way reproach or defame them, with the most malicious and intollerable brand of injustice; and that by the authority communicat to them by His <hi>Majesty,</hi> in their office, and which is also asserted, and cleared by His gracious Letter, of the 19. of <hi>May,</hi> 1674. Whereof there is no alteration, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation in that point, by His Letter of the 11. of <hi>December,</hi> 1675. bearing expresly, to be in pursuance of His <hi>Majesties</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pleasure. And the saids Lords ordains this Act to be insert in the Books of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> and to be Printed.</p>
